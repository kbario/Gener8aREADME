If any of these things are not up to standard, you risk people not contributing to your project or others not taking you seriously.\nBy automating the production of a README from a professional template - such as that that Gener8aREADME works off of - you garuantee that all the bases of a good README are covered, allowing you to focus on the developing of the project.\nGener8aREADME was developed using JavaScript, Node.js and Inquirer.",
