## Description
Gener8aREADME is a CLI application that takes inputs and dynamically creates a README.md file based on these inputs. \n\n Gener8aREADME solves the issue of creating the tedious but crucial README file. README's can take a long time to make, which is time not spent developing your code; but they are very important, and can be the make or break of a project. Gener8aREADME uses a professional template to create it's README's so you can rest assured you are  going to get a high-quality file that covers all the bases. Also, Licenses, codes of conduct, tables of content and images are all taken care of mean you need to only worry about the content of your file and not how it looks. \n\n Ultimately, Gener8aREADME ensures your project is professional, developer-friendly and elevates your github repos.

### Colour-Coded Questions

The questions presented in the command line are colour-coded depending on what you can do with them or what actions the entail. \n\n Green writing is used to indicate information to better enable your use of the app. \n\n Yellow questions indicate that you can use markdown styling in your answer which will appear in the final README. For instance using a line break (\\n\\n) or **** which will bold text. \n\n Blue writing indicates that images can be added into the README by answering yes to this quesiton. After the file is created, add the image you want to be shown for that section by naming it imgOne.png if its for the first section, or imgTwo.png for the second and so on. This is done in the assets folder created by the app. These images then automatically appear in the README.
